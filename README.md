# PowerMateKit
This is a library for communicating with Griffin [PowerMate](https://griffintechnology.com/us/powermate) USB controllers. It is a fork of [PMDemo](https://github.com/somegeekintn/PMDemo) by Casey Fleser.

Included are a framework project (Carthage compatible) along with a demo project (PMDemo). My modifications are small and intended to ease integrating this project for myself. I'm unable to provide any support for it.
